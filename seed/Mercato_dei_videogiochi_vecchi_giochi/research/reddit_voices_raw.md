### POST BODY (verbatim excerpt):
"I started selling some games I had (mainly on Vinted, as I'm based in Europe) in late 2021 and saw a huge amount of interesting games on there, as well as some titles that are rare and expensive in my country but cheap to find in others. It's incredibly easy to order and ship items on Vinted, an before I knew it this occupational therapy turned into a business of sorts."

"Know your niches [...] a game like Don Bradman Cricket 2014 (PS3) got a very limited release, no store dares to charge more than $15 for it but there's certainly a collector out there who is still looking to add this title to their collection, meaning you can pretty much ask whatever you want"

"Stores and other 'flippers' often look at games with a much different view than collectors do, this is where knowing your niche comes in hand."

"Webstores are your friend [...] I have made probably around 30% of my profits from various webstores whose items been publicly available, something for months or years, and have a great profit margin."

"Language differences [...] The best example for now would be the French. French people want French versions of their games. Period. [...] Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 Battle Nexus (Gamecube), which is already a very valuable game at around €250, goes for €1100+ if it's a 'FAH' (French) version."

"games released in Italy and Germany are almost always released with an Italian or German packaging [...] One would be Yggdra Union (GBA) which goes for €200 when it's a new and sealed copy. However there are new and sealed copies available from Italy that are very easy to find at just €40"

"Don't trust Pricecharting (too much) [...] Pricecharting does not do a great job (at all) in differentiating between regular, Platinum, or limited releases of the same game."

"Know the product, love the product. Not only does having a genuine interest in games mean that flipping never feels like work, it also means you have a genuine good time finding and selling the games. You'll probably even end up getting regular customers who recognize your passion and knowledge."

### COMMENTI (verbatim):
- u/commenter1 (score 24): "Video Games are and have been the most over saturated flipping category for at least the last 10 years, you can't even call it a niche anymore because everyone and their grandma knows to look out for them. Finding video games to flip these days is mostly just random luck of being at the right place at the right time, it's like picking a winning lotto scratcher."

- u/commenter2 (score 11): "I feel like a grandpa saying this but I used to find lots on Craigslist, local garage sales, pawn and thrift shops or even on eBay of ps1/ps2/n64/DS/GameCube games that were such a cash cow. Now though, I never find anything that I would consider worth my time/selling."

- u/commenter3 (score 0, negativo): "good for you. ruining the market for people who just want to play old games for fun. imagine if you spent all that time learning how to invest in stocks and you wouldn't be chasing $10 $15 profit on toys"

Score: 512

### POST BODY (verbatim):
"I can't stand when people say game collecting is a 'good investment'. To each their own an everything but I can't stand when people say game collecting is a 'good investment'. If you're collecting just for a investment your priorities are a bit off imo. [...] I been recently debating selling my collection due to personal reasons, I've spent near 100k in 15-20 years on a collection that's worth only 90k, after eBay fee's, shipping, shipping supplies and taxes I would've only gotten around [less than invested]"

### COMMENTI (verbatim):
- (su Daniel Thompson, Vintage Gaming Market Analyst, Alibaba): "Collecting retro games purely for profit is risky. You need deep knowledge, patience, and access to well-preserved stock. It's not like buying index funds."

## SOURCE C: r/gamecollecting — "Grading question"
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/gamecollecting/comments/1re3rw2/

### COMMENTI (verbatim):
- (score 17): "Grading was brought into the videogames hobby by money hungry speculators who don't have any interest beyond hype and value"
- (score 9): "I'd sooner sell my whole collection than to grade anything. I really try to let people do their own thing and not judge, but grading games is fucking stupid."
- (score 8): "Collecting sealed and graded games is pretty niche within this hobby and especially people who collect them based on value and potential profits later have a bit of a bad reputation."
- (score 4): "The same people who ruined comics, sports cards and CCGs by grading them are the same ones who ruined the video game hobby by grading games."
- (score 4): "I buy video games to play them not to grade them, they're meant to be enjoyed."
- (score 4): "I buy video games to theoretically play them but mostly stare at the cases and imagine a future where i can afford the time to play them. Sweet sweet cases."
- (score 3): "Games are different from trading cards as most people buy to play them. Even for retro games, people will still play them on old consoles rather than just collecting. Graded games cannot be played and hence worthless to a lot of people."

## SOURCE D: r/gamecollecting — "How would you feel if worth $5?"
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/gamecollecting/comments/1res250/

### COMMENTI (verbatim):
- (score 6): "I'd 100% be ok with it. I play everything I own and that includes the $200-300 games. Its more of the treasure hunt in the store that matters and also the memories with my girls."
- (score 6): "Fine by me I didnt treat my games as an investment vehicle their value is irrelevant to me. Hell the only reason ive sold games is because I think theyre too expensive and I feel guilty having a $500 dollar game when that could be in an investment account making my life and my families lives easier someday. Id have a much cleaner conscience holding onto games when theyre worthless outside of my joy."
- (score 2): "I'm not buying my games to resell, but I do like knowing my collection has value in case an emergency comes up later in life and I need some money."
- (score 1): "I couldn't care less if my collection was worth 50p or £5 million. I collect because I like to."
- (score 1): "I would be a little bummed out but then realize I could buy more games for cheap like it's 2012 lmao"
- (score 1): "So incredibly happy that I could get more games and special edition consoles for cheaper assuming everything crashes buying or selling."
- (score 1): "Be mad at myself for all the money I wasted but grateful I can continue to build my collection up for super duper cheap."

## SOURCE E: r/gamecollecting — "Local retro game store closed"
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/gamecollecting/comments/1qeizuw/

### POST BODY (verbatim):
"They werent the cheapest but at least their prices were consistent and they had good stock. now the only options are overpriced flea market vendors or hoping to get lucky at thrift stores. Ive been trying to find games online but half the time good listings are already sold before I can even check them out properly, i really miss being able to browse physical inventory and actually see the condition before buying, and now I realize how good I had it."

### COMMENTI (verbatim):
- (score 95): "They are getting harder to find every year and its killing the hobby honestly, online isnt the same"
- (score 22): "Local store closed last year [...] rather than drop prices gradually on high value things slightly over time, they got what was basically normal FMV+10-25% on top...and never went on sale or was willing to haggle. Shop went under, everything is on eBay still probably three months after closing."
- (score 42): "I own an LCS; the overhead is INSANE. Our fixed monthly costs are 10k/mo just to break even"
- (score 42): "I worry about the day this happens to me. I really like being able to just walk in a store, find an old game I want, and then walk out."
- (score 6): "With economic conditions being what they are, I expect this to happen to a lot more stores. The biggest problem retro game stores have is keeping consistent inventory in stock"

### POST BODY (verbatim):
"I listed the sale with video games, comics, records, and cards in the title so I knew what I should prepare for and I encountered every type of buyer. [...] The ones that came for video games…just unrelenting. One started messaging at 1:30 AM to gain early access"

## SOURCE G: r/gamecollecting — "Life sucks, selling collection"

### POST BODY (verbatim):
"My brother is sick and my parents are doing everything they can in order to afford treatment. I want to contribute but my collection is the only thing I have of value that can make a difference. I never thought I would have to sell my collection and I don't even know where to start. If anyone can offer advice on if I should sell individually and even how to without getting scammed"

### COMMENTI (verbatim):
- (score 677): "You'll get more money if you sell individually but it will take much longer, selling in bulk will have you putting a fair discount on everything but you'll get a bulk of cash immediately."
- (score 339): "Honestly, I wouldn't. Like, genuinely not trying to be rude, majority of these games arent really worth much would be difficult to sell/wouldn't get much if you did sell them."
- (score 65): "As someone who sold my collection off during uni to afford food and has spent ten years rebuilding: First identify things that you're the least willing to part with. [...] Next look everything up on Price Charting BUT also look at the details of the recently sold and come up with a number yourself, then drop your price"
- (score 11): "If you can part with your Pokemon games you'll honestly get way more for those than probably the rest of your collection combined"

## SOURCE H: r/gamecollecting — "Vinted gamble £10"
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/gamecollecting/comments/1reryy9/

### POST BODY (verbatim):
"Saw this listed on Vinted for a tenner and the photos were pretty grainy, but something about the box wear looked 'right' to me so I took the risk. It just arrived and my hunch was 100% correct—fully authentic Player's Choice FireRed CIB. [...] I'm honestly still a bit shocked that deals like this still exist in 2026. My luck is officially peaked for the year."

### COMMENTI (verbatim):
- (score 30): "How are you guys finding these deals? All I'm getting are scams."
- (score 23): "I refuse to believe someone knew how to make a peacock spread but didn't know this was a $400 game"
- (score 3): "Nice, I've had some gems on vinted including CIB leaf green for £45, CIB magical quest 3 for £8 and CIB Zelda links awakening dx for £40"

## SOURCE I: r/gamecollecting — "Pokemon artificially inflated"
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/gamecollecting/comments/1devrko/

### POST BODY (verbatim):
"For the longest time Pokemon DS games were selling for $25-$30CAD each [...] I just went over our inventory numbers from 2013 until 2023 and in that time our small independent game store has had 2076 Pokemon games come and go through our doors. There have been 460,000,000 Pokemon games made worldwide. That is almost HALF A BILLION copies of Pokemon games so far."

### COMMENTI (verbatim):
- (score 509): "Rare games aren't always expensive and common games aren't always cheap. It's supply and demand."
- (score 182): "You are literally a reseller lol."
- (score 125): "This is not true for Pokemon games. They are expensive because demand is high. They aren't rare. We all know that. But people want them. They want them bad! Its like Earthbound. That game isn't rare. It sold millions of copies. But it's expensive because everyone wants one."
- (score 95): "When I sell my used games locally, the pokemon games are the first to go every single time. None last more than an hour after posting."
- (score 27): "It's supply and demand. Pokemon games are expensive because it's not just hard core collectors who want them."

## SOURCE J: ItaliaIoVideogioco — Retrogaming bene di lusso

Autore: Pask | Data: 6 Febbraio 2026

### VERBATIM:
"Per chi osserva il mondo del retrogaming con l'esperienza di chi lo frequenta da vent'anni, il consiglio per i neofiti è spesso spiazzante: meglio non iniziare, a meno che non si disponga di una passione incrollabile e di un budget considerevole."

"Il cambiamento più radicale è avvenuto negli ultimi anni. Il retrogaming 'puro', quello che rifiuta l'emulazione e le moderne riedizioni digitali per cercare l'esperienza autentica su cartuccia e disco, ha visto i propri prezzi schizzare verso l'alto."

"La rarità non è più l'unico parametro: oggi, lo stato di conservazione è il vero ago della bilancia. Un gioco completo di scatola, manuale e inserti originali può raggiungere cifre vertiginose, mentre il settore del 'sealed' (i titoli mai aperti) è diventato terreno esclusivo per investitori e collezionisti di alto profilo."

"Titoli che nel 2009 potevano essere acquistati completi per 30 euro, come Kirby's Fun Pack per Super Nintendo, oggi vedono la sola cartuccia sfiorare i 70 euro."

"Sebbene esistano ancora margini di manovra per chi accetta compromessi, come l'acquisto di prodotti incompleti o privi di libretto, l'impegno richiesto oggi è infinitamente superiore rispetto al passato."

"I've arrived at the point where I'm going to begin selling off, and I decided to take pics of how everything turned out. I worked at a video store in 1996 and began buying all of the clearance NES stuff at that time. From there, the collection started to grow, and I suppose this is the collection's final form."
