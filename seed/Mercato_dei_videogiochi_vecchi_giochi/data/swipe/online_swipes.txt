---TESTO VERBATIM---

"I started selling some games I had (mainly on Vinted, as I'm based in Europe) in late 2021 and saw a huge amount of interesting games on there, as well as some titles that are rare and expensive in my country but cheap to find in others. It's incredibly easy to order and ship items on Vinted, and before I knew it this occupational therapy turned into a business of sorts."

"Know your niches. One of the most important aspects to this business is knowing a particular niche. My primary personal niche is PS3 games (and consoles). At this point everyone knows Pokémon games are worth something, and while it's fun to go to thrift shops hoping to find that Ocarina of Time for $5, it often ends up being a waste of time, or at least not worth the time."

"Knowing a niche means you find games that others who are looking for a profit have already overlooked. For example: sports games are worth nothing, right? Both the shops and buyers know this at this point. But a game like Don Bradman Cricket 2014 (PS3) got a very limited release, no store dares to charge more than $15 for it but there's certainly a collector out there who is still looking to add this title to their collection, meaning you can pretty much ask whatever you want."

"Also, collectors love weird and unique releases. Take this 'twinpack' for example. Both Resistance 1 and 2 are worth close to nothing, (especially the Platinum versions) which means that even when sold as this bundle, it's quite cheap. Collectors love this though and are willing to certainly pay more than you did."

"Also, special promo/review/press copies such as these definitely need to be mentioned. While they're not inherently any different from the regular release content-wise (in 99% of cases), the ones of the more beloved and collectable franchises are often VERY valuable. Many stores and sellers are completely unaware of this [...] a guy who was selling PS3 games [...] had one of these was a promo copy of Red Dead Redemption for PS3. Paid €15, sold it for €240 within hours."

"Webstores are your friend. Most of those who want to make a profit will instinctively look at places such as eBay, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace or their local alternative, and rightfully so. However I have made probably around 30% of my profits from various webstores whose items been publicly available, something for months or years, and have a great profit margin."

"Language differences [...] The best example for now would be the French. French people want French versions of their games. Period. [...] Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 Battle Nexus (Gamecube), which is already a very valuable game at around €250, goes for €1100+ if it's a 'FAH' (French) version."

"Don't trust Pricecharting (too much). I'm sure many of you know and use pricecharting.com, but trust me when I say this is not a great indicator, at least for Europeans."

"Backwards compatible PS3 models [...] This tip will give your chance at scoring one of these probably around a 300% increase, based on my experience."

"Many people selling their 'faulty' PS3 and PS4 consoles for a very low price, and in many cases it's just a software error which requires you to insert a USB stick and reinstall the system software."

"Know the product, love the product. Not only does having a genuine interest in games mean that flipping never feels like work, it also means you have a genuine good time finding and selling the games. You'll probably even end up getting regular customers who recognize your passion and knowledge."

---TESTO VERBATIM---

"Buying and reselling classic video games can be a fun hobby and potentially lucrative side business. While it takes knowledge, patience, and effort, profits can be made by buying games for low prices and reselling them for higher amounts."

"Rarity – Common sports titles have lower demand than rare cult classics and platform exclusives. Prioritize rarer items."

"Brands – Flagship series like Mario, Pokemon, Sonic, Zelda, etc. hold value better than generic licensed titles."

"Special/Limited Editions – Low print run variants with extras included sell for higher premiums."

"Completion – Box, instructions manual, overlays, posters raise complete game values versus loose carts only."

"Common titles typically yield 25-50% margins. Rare games can command 50-100%+ profit margins when bought ultra cheap."

"Consider bundling together loose common games into affordable value lots to help move stale inventory."

"Reinvest a portion of proceeds into buying larger wholesale inventory lots for lower per-unit costs. Improves margins."

"Build connections with avid collectors interested in premium items for sale/trade. Satisfy their desires for Holy Grail games."

"Q: Can good buying deals still be found for vintage games amid rising market prices? A: Absolutely. Many casual sellers are still unaware of new higher value price trends and just want to quickly unload old games found in basements or garages."

"Q: What is a realistic initial budget to get started buying and reselling video games for profit? A: $500 – $1000 can purchase enough quality starter inventory to begin refurbishing and listing items for sale."

TIPO: Articolo educativo/investment guide

---TESTO VERBATIM---

"The retro gaming market has absolutely exploded in recent years. Rare vintage games that sold for a few bucks in the 90s now fetch hundreds or thousands of dollars at auction. This has led some collectors to view old video games as potential investments."

"Nostalgia – The 90s kid demographic has grown up and has money to spend reliving childhood nostalgia."

"Limited supply – Far lower production runs on cartridges vs. modern digital titles."

"Community – YouTube, streaming, and conventions have strengthened collector networks."

"Investor speculation – High prices drive interest in flipping for profit like a virtual stock market."

"Grading services – Professional grading builds confidence in an unregulated market."

RISCHI:
"No guarantees on future appreciation – Prices could stagnate or collapse if interest fades."
"High production runs – 1990s games sold tens of millions of units versus hundreds or thousands for coins and comics."
"Counterfeits – Fake sealed games and repro boxes flood the market, requiring authentication skills."
"Storage and insurance costs – Protecting a high-value collection isn't cheap."

RENDIMENTI STORICI CITATI:
"Complete-in-box (CIB) Super Mario Bros for NES sold for around $50 in 2000, now sells for $600+ today."
"A CIB Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Collector's Edition for N64 was $80 in 2010, now $250."
"Sealed Pokemon Crystal for Game Boy Color sold under $60 in 2015, now consistently over $1000."
"Complete Stadium Events sold for $13,000 in 2010 and has grossed over $100,000 in recent years."

"These demonstrate 10-40X returns on graded CIB games over 5-20 year hold periods."

"Do you have at least $5000-$10,000 to start a diversified portfolio?"
"Are you comfortable holding long-term, possibly 10+ years?"

"In a world where online marketplaces have flourished, flipping rare video game items has become a profitable venture for many enthusiasts. With the rising popularity of retro gaming and the nostalgia associated with classic titles, there exists a market hungry for exclusive and hard-to-find gaming collectibles."

"I decided to focus on retro gaming consoles, limited edition bundles, and rare game cartridges as they seemed to have the highest demand."

"This stage of the experiment was exhilarating, as I stumbled upon some fantastic finds that I knew would attract eager gamers. However, it wasn't always smooth sailing. Sometimes, I would endure hours of fruitless searching without any successful discoveries. However, patience paid off."

"The profit margin on some items was truly mind-blowing, leading me to dub it 'insane profit.'"

"The profitability of video game flipping heavily relies on several factors. These include market demand, rarity, condition, and sellers' knowledge of current trends."

"Honesty in listings, prompt shipping, and fair pricing contribute to building a positive reputation within the gaming community, which, in turn, helps attract more buyers and repeat customers."

"Gaming is a big market. It's huge actually. Since 2020, the gaming industry has brought in over $200 billion in revenue every year."

"Collector's editions are a reseller's bread and butter."

"The last few years have seen a tremendous increase in prices for vintage games. What used to be lowkey hobby for collectors has exploded, and now sealed copies of games have sold for tens of thousands of dollars in the past."

"Check the usual haunts: thrift stores, yard sales, local listings on Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace. Your local game stores likely won't be a help, as they'll be selling games at the prices you would want to list them at."

"You'll need to be lucky and knowledgeable to make a profit here, which is why the line between video game collector and video game reseller tend to blur."

"Nothing is ever certain. While games are a big industry, they're also volatile. Even huge projects with massive budgets can flop."

"Per chi osserva il mondo del retrogaming con l'esperienza di chi lo frequenta da vent'anni, il consiglio per i neofiti è spesso spiazzante: meglio non iniziare, a meno che non si disponga di una passione incrollabile e di un budget considerevole."

"Quello che un tempo era un passatempo per appassionati di tecnologia vintage si è infatti trasformato in un settore dominato da logiche di mercato vicine ai beni di lusso, rendendo l'accesso all'hardware e al software originale un privilegio per pochi."

"Il retrogaming 'puro', quello che rifiuta l'emulazione e le moderne riedizioni digitali per cercare l'esperienza autentica su cartuccia e disco, ha visto i propri prezzi schizzare verso l'alto. La rarità non è più l'unico parametro: oggi, lo stato di conservazione è il vero ago della bilancia."

"Un gioco completo di scatola, manuale e inserti originali può raggiungere cifre vertiginose, mentre il settore del 'sealed' (i titoli mai aperti) è diventato terreno esclusivo per investitori e collezionisti di alto profilo."

"Titoli che nel 2009 potevano essere acquistati completi per 30 euro, come Kirby's Fun Pack per Super Nintendo, oggi vedono la sola cartuccia sfiorare i 70 euro."

"Persino i grandi classici un tempo diffusissimi, come Super Mario World o Donkey Kong Country, hanno raggiunto quotazioni di mercato che superano i prezzi di lancio delle moderne produzioni per PlayStation 5."

"Questo fenomeno è alimentato da una domanda crescente che ha spinto i venditori a cavalcare l'onda del fascino vintage, talvolta gonfiando i prezzi in modo poco logico."

"Trovare copie integre di titoli per console Nintendo o PS1 è sempre più difficile a causa dell'usura del tempo."

"Il collezionismo retro rimane un viaggio affascinante, ma richiede la consapevolezza che ogni pezzo aggiunto allo scaffale potrebbe richiedere sacrifici economici importanti."

"The retro video game has never been stronger just look at the prices and popularity that is all over social media."

"According to the Entertainment Software Association, approximately 190.6 million Americans play video games in 2024, representing 61% of the U.S. population. A Consumer Reports survey found that 14% of gamers still actively use retro gaming consoles such as the NES, Sega Genesis, TurboGrafx-16, PlayStation, Dreamcast, PS2, GameCube, and Game Boy."

"Applying this percentage to the total gaming population, we estimate that around 26.7 million Americans engage in retro gaming. That is a lot of customers!"

"With the total U.S. video game content revenue reaching $50.6 billion in 2024, we can estimate that retro gaming accounts for approximately $7.08 billion annually."

"The resurgence of retro gaming is fueled by multiple factors, including nostalgia, game preservation, and the increasing value of physical media, driven up by fans and specifically ramped up by retro gaming YouTubers."

"Unlike modern digital sales, retro game transactions frequently occur in private marketplaces, collector forums, retro gaming conventions, and second-hand retailers. This decentralized nature makes it difficult to track exact sales figures."

"As today's gamers age, their attachment to childhood gaming experiences will persist, ensuring demand for classic titles and systems. Future retirement homes may feature arcade machines and retro consoles as a way to keep residents entertained."

"Graded video games, a relative newcomer to the collectible ecosystem, experienced a rapid boom in demand during the pandemic alongside other alternative investments."

"In the summer of 2021, record-breaking sales captured the public's attention: a copy of Super Mario 64 sold for $1.56M in July, which was quickly followed by Rally's own example of Super Mario Bros. selling for $2M just a month later."

"Beginning in 2022, there was a significant correction in the video game market in both total dollar volume sold at auction and the average price per game sold."

"At the height of the market in Q3 2021, Heritage Video Games Signature Auction achieved $8.4M in total sales with an average sale price of $17k. In the most recent Video Games Signature Auction (April 2023), Heritage had just $2.2M in total sales with an average sale price of $6k, representing a decline of 73% and 66%, respectively."

"From July 2021 to April 2023, unique bidders per auction only decreased by 14% as compared to a 73% decline in total auction sales, which suggests resilient demand among buyers."

"Median sale price decreased by 13% while, average sale price dropped 66%."

"In 2021, there were six games that each sold for over $500,000 at public auction. In 2022, only one game sold for $500,000 and in 2023, no game has sold for more than $120,000."

"Owners of rare examples seem to be hesitant to sell in adverse market conditions."

"The market frenzy leading to record-breaking prices for retro games appears to have slowed since last year, but frustration over the collectible grading firm at the center of the spike hasn't."

"They accuse Wata Games and owner Collectors Universe of pumping up a bubble around retro game collecting, misleading customers, and a 'pattern of racketeering activity.'"

"The top price for a retro game in 2017 was $30,000 for a high-quality sealed copy of Super Mario Bros. In 2019, a Wata-graded copy of the same game sold for an eye-popping $100,150 through a widely publicized sale auction."

"Wata founder Deniz Kahn (the chief grader) went on the TV show Pawn Stars to say that the same copy was worth as much as $300,000. By last year, what Wata described as an ultra-rare boxed and sealed variation of Super Mario Bros. was selling for $2 million."

"At the Heritage auction in July 2021, a Wata-graded sealed copy with a rating of '9.8 A++' sold for $1,560,000. At an auction run by competing auction house Goldin Auctions in September, a similarly rated copy went for just $800,000. Then at a Goldin auction in October, a copy of the game VGA had rated as 'MINT 95' went for just $240,000."

"Recently, the term 'Retro Games' has gained much attention from many people. There are many retro games that have been rereleased with new features and refined graphics, making classic video game collecting a new hobby for many."

"This hobby has become increasingly expensive, with the prices of classic 'retro' games from previous console generations skyrocketing in recent years. Games once considered niche curios now command prices rivaling vintage art at auction. These prices are over 3 to 5 times higher than the original prices."

"The second-hand game shops in Akihabara [...] stated that the increasing popularity of retro games overseas caused this price rise. They also claimed that the number of international tourists visiting the shop had surpassed the number of Japanese clients."

"Furthermore, there is a trend of collecting these 'retro' games as an investment following a copy of unopened Super Mario Bros 1985 to be sold at $2 million in the auction. The number of retro games only decreases and never increases, which adds a premium value to these collections."

"Beyond just nostalgic sentiment, several factors drive the retro game price surge. Their age makes finding complete, undamaged games and packaging difficult."

"In recent games, it is common to have online connections with other players and extra content that can be purchased to advance gameplay. These factors could cause unnecessary stress in gaming [...] On the other hand, the retro game solely focuses on players' skills and does not require in-game purchases."
