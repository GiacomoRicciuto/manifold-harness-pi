### STATO ATTUALE / SITUAZIONE

**Collezionista con 30 anni di esperienza, ora in fase di vendita**
— r/gamecollecting, ID 1r92mev, score 4.227, Feb 2026
"I've arrived at the point where I'm going to begin selling off, and I decided to take pics of how everything turned out. I worked at a video store in 1996 and began buying all of the clearance NES stuff at that time. From there, the collection started to grow, and I suppose this is the collection's final form."

**Collezionista 15 anni, tutto thriftato**
— r/gamecollecting, ID 1ncwatl, score 865
"I've been collecting since about 2020 when my siblings and I got the switch. The majority of everything here is thrifted, almost nothing I've bought at full market value [...] I swear I'm not rich or anything, a lot of the stuff I've been given was free from families members who have long sinced not cared about any of it"

**Piccolo flipper europeo (Vinted-first), 18 mesi, €13.500**
— r/Flipping u/Dezuuu, score ~500, Aprile 2023
"I started selling some games I had (mainly on Vinted, as I'm based in Europe) in late 2021 and saw a huge amount of interesting games on there, as well as some titles that are rare and expensive in my country but cheap to find in others. It's incredibly easy to order and ship items on Vinted, an before I knew it this occupational therapy turned into a business of sorts."

**Negozio locale chiuso, collezionista in difficoltà**
— r/gamecollecting, ID 1qeizuw, score 341
"They werent the cheapest but at least their prices were consistent and they had good stock. now the only options are overpriced flea market vendors or hoping to get lucky at thrift stores. Ive been trying to find games online but half the time good listings are already sold before I can even check them out properly, i really miss being able to browse physical inventory and actually see the condition before buying, and now I realize how good I had it."

**Collezionista italiano: mercato diventato bene di lusso**
— ItaliaIoVideogioco, 6 Febbraio 2026, autore: Pask
"Per chi osserva il mondo del retrogaming con l'esperienza di chi lo frequenta da vent'anni, il consiglio per i neofiti è spesso spiazzante: meglio non iniziare, a meno che non si disponga di una passione incrollabile e di un budget considerevole."

**Situazione del mercato fisico locale**
— r/gamecollecting, commento score 22
"Local store closed last year [...] rather than drop prices gradually on high value things slightly over time, they got what was basically normal FMV+10-25% on top...and never went on sale or was willing to haggle. Shop went under, everything is on eBay still probably three months after closing."

**Proprietario di negozio locale, situazione economica attuale**
— r/gamecollecting, commento score 42
"I own an LCS; the overhead is INSANE. Our fixed monthly costs are 10k/mo just to break even, and thats with just 1 employee besides myself, and thats before purchasing inventory restock. We're barely surviving each month"

### PUNTI DI DOLORE

**Dolore #1 — La competizione e la saturazione del mercato**
— r/Flipping, commento score 24
"Video Games are and have been the most over saturated flipping category for at least the last 10 years, you can't even call it a niche anymore because everyone and their grandma knows to look out for them. Finding video games to flip these days is mostly just random luck of being at the right place at the right time, it's like picking a winning lotto scratcher. You should always look out for video game stuff, but if you think video games are going to be your sole focus in flipping, you're gonna have a bad time."

**Dolore #2 — I prezzi al dettaglio sono diventati irraggiungibili**
— ItaliaIoVideogioco, 6 Febbraio 2026
"Titoli che nel 2009 potevano essere acquistati completi per 30 euro, come Kirby's Fun Pack per Super Nintendo, oggi vedono la sola cartuccia sfiorare i 70 euro. Persino i grandi classici un tempo diffusissimi, come Super Mario World o Donkey Kong Country, hanno raggiunto quotazioni di mercato che superano i prezzi di lancio delle moderne produzioni per PlayStation 5."

**Dolore #3 — I giochi buoni vengono venduti prima che tu possa vederli**
— r/gamecollecting, score 341
"Ive been trying to find games online but half the time good listings are already sold before I can even check them out properly"

**Dolore #4 — Falsificazioni in aumento, impossibile fidarsi**
— r/gamecollecting, ID "BE CAREFUL Mega Man X3", score 121, 2026
"I want to bring attention to this because this is the 2nd time in the last 5 months I've come across a SNES copy of Mega Man X3 with this BS fake label and what bothers me is how close it is to the real thing."

— r/gamecollecting, post "Where can I get Pokemon guaranteed authentic"
"Shopping on eBay I do tend to be good about spotting fakes but sometimes it's hard to tell and I might miss a small giveaway."

— r/gamecollecting, commento su Vinted, score 30
"How are you guys finding these deals? All I'm getting are scams."

**Dolore #5 — Non sai mai cosa vale veramente**
— r/Flipping, commento score 11
"I feel like a grandpa saying this but I used to find lots on Craigslist, local garage sales, pawn and thrift shops or even on eBay of ps1/ps2/n64/DS/GameCube games that were such a cash cow. Now though, I never find anything that I would consider worth my time/selling. I still go to all of the same places and types of sales but it's so easy to value things yourself these days that video games are too competitive and theirs never any meat on the bone."

**Dolore #6 — Pricecharting non è affidabile per il mercato europeo**
— r/Flipping, u/Dezuuu
"Don't trust Pricecharting (too much) [...] Pricecharting does not do a great job (at all) in differentiating between regular, Platinum, or limited releases of the same game."

— r/Flipping, commento (Aussie flipper), score 3
"My disdain for price charting knows no bounds. The fact that every man and his dog is starting to use it is annoying, even more so that Pricecharting doesn't include AUS sales."

**Dolore #7 — Le fee eBay e le tasse erodono i margini**
— r/gamecollecting, post score 512
"I've spent near 100k in 15-20 years on a collection that's worth only 90k, after eBay fee's, shipping, shipping supplies and taxes I would've only gotten around [meno di quanto investito]"

**Dolore #8 — Trovare la condizione giusta è quasi impossibile online**
— r/gamecollecting, score 341
"i really miss being able to browse physical inventory and actually see the condition before buying"

— ItaliaIoVideogioco, Feb 2026
"Oltre al fattore economico, la sfida è dettata dalla deperibilità: trovare copie integre di titoli per console Nintendo o PS1 è sempre più difficile a causa dell'usura del tempo."

**Dolore #9 — Compratori aggressivi e non rispettosi**
— r/gamecollecting, post score 1208 (garage sale)
"The ones that came for video games…just unrelenting. One started messaging at 1:30 AM to gain early access"

**Dolore #10 — Essere piccoli significa non poter competere sui grandi lotti**
— r/gamecollecting, commento score 677 (a chi deve vendere per emergenza)
"You'll get more money if you sell individually but it will take much longer, selling in bulk will have you putting a fair discount on everything but you'll get a bulk of cash immediately."

### SOLUZIONI GIÀ PROVATE

**Soluzione #1 — eBay (piattaforma principale storica)**
— r/gamecollecting (multipli post)
Utilizzato per: vendita individuale, ricerca prezzi sold, sourcing. Critiche: fee alte, saturazione, compra da tutto il mondo.

**Soluzione #2 — Negozi fisici locali**
— r/gamecollecting, commento score 42
"I worry about the day this happens to me. I really like being able to just walk in a store, find an old game I want, and then walk out."
Critiche: prezzi FMV+10-25%, chiusure in aumento, non trovano più stock fresco.

**Soluzione #3 — Garage sale / mercatini / thrift stores**
— r/gamecollecting, score 920 (heart sank post)
"I never can get up early to go to any garage sales and when I do, I never have any luck finding any OG Xbox or Gameboy/DS games."
Critiche: tutto già "skimmato" prima che apra al pubblico, richiede alzarsi presto.

**Soluzione #4 — Vinted (europeo, in crescita)**
— r/gamecollecting, 2026
"Saw this listed on Vinted for a tenner and the photos were pretty grainy, but something about the box wear looked 'right' to me so I took the risk. It just arrived and my hunch was 100% correct—fully authentic Player's Choice FireRed CIB."
"Nice, I've had some gems on vinted including CIB leaf green for £45, CIB magical quest 3 for £8 and CIB Zelda links awakening dx for £40"

**Soluzione #5 — Facebook Marketplace / Craigslist**
— r/gamecollecting, score 1199 (parcheggio pawn shop)
"Parked to enter a pawn shop and before I could even enter I was greeted by a man trying to sell me his games."
— r/Flipping, score 316
"Craigslist has become a gold mine for sourcing [...] I've found collectibles lots that have 3 to 5x'd the money I invested just by flipping the entire collection on marketplace or ebay without separating."

**Soluzione #6 — Webstore locali / negozi online di retrogaming**
— r/Flipping, u/Dezuuu
"I recommend diving deep into Google search results for 'local retro games' etc., it will be worth your while. [...] I have made probably around 30% of my profits from various webstores whose items been publicly available, something for months or years, and have a great profit margin."

**Soluzione #7 — PriceCharting come guida prezzi**
— utilizzato dalla maggioranza dei collezionisti, ma considerato inaffidabile per Europa
"Don't trust Pricecharting (too much)"

**Soluzione #8 — Grading (WATA, VGA)**
— r/gamecollecting, commenti su grading
"Grading was brought into the videogames hobby by money hungry speculators who don't have any interest beyond hype and value"
→ soluzione rigettata dalla maggioranza della community gamer/collezionista

— r/gamecollecting, commento score 22

"When I sell my used games locally, the pokemon games are the first to go every single time. None last more than an hour after posting."
→ aspettativa: se il prezzo è giusto, si vende subito.

**Aspettativa #7 — Niente bullshit, niente hype da investimento**
— r/gamecollecting, score 9
"I'd sooner sell my whole collection than to grade anything. [...] grading games is fucking stupid."

**Aspettativa #8 — Possibilità di trovare ancora deals veri**
— r/gamecollecting, Vinted gamble 2026
"I'm honestly still a bit shocked that deals like this still exist in 2026."
→ aspettativa (quasi speranza): che esistano ancora venditori onesti con prezzi pre-hype.

### PAURE E OBIEZIONI

**Paura #1 — Comprare falsi / essere truffati**
— r/gamecollecting, commento Vinted 2026, score 30

— r/gamecollecting, "Buying off eBay" post
"I'm looking for [...] I won't get scammed by getting a fake version of the game."

**Paura #2 — Overpaying, pagare troppo senza saperlo**
— RetroTechLab (citazione verbatim da ricerca mercato)
"Mistake #1: Overpaying for Games — affects 65% of Collectors"

— Daniel Thompson, Vintage Gaming Market Analyst (Alibaba Insights)
"Collecting retro games purely for profit is risky. You need deep knowledge, patience, and access to well-preserved stock. It's not like buying index funds."

**Paura #3 — Il mercato crolla e perdo il mio investimento**
— Rally Research (dati Q2 2023)
"Crollo -73% volume aste Heritage da Q3 2021 ad aprile 2023"

— Alibaba Insights (PriceCharting data)
"Only about 5% of all retro games listed on their platform have increased in average resale value by more than 300% over the past ten years. The rest remain stagnant or fluctuate within a narrow range."

**Paura #4 — La bolla scoppierà come con le carte Pokémon nel 2021**
— Scandal WATA/Heritage (Kotaku, 2022)

**Paura #5 — Non riesco a vendere ciò che compro (liquidità)**
— r/gamecollecting, commento score 339
"Honestly, I wouldn't [sell]. [...] majority of these games arent really worth much would be difficult to sell/wouldn't get much if you did sell them. [...] at the end you'd have barely any money to contribute, AND you'd no longer have your collection."

**Paura #6 — Essere bannati da eBay**
— r/Flipping, post score 305
"I've been permanently banned from eBay, and I feel I was treated like a criminal [...] I started selling on eBay back in 2013 and built up a solid history — a few hundred positive ratings, very few negatives, and I also spent around €30,000 buying items over the years (yeah, a lot, not that it matters). [...] If they had told me to take the listings down, I would have done so immediately, no questions"

**Paura #7 — Non avere le competenze per distinguere le rarità**
— r/gamecollecting, score 0
"I stumbled upon another Konami game, Tornado Outbreak. When cataloged on PriceCharting, I didn't know Tornado Outbreak went for that much. Lucky find I guess."
→ paura implicita: perdere un'opportunità per ignoranza.

**Paura #8 — Il mercato italiano è troppo caro / bloccato**
— ItaliaIoVideogioco, 2026
"il collezionismo retro rimane un viaggio affascinante, ma richiede la consapevolezza che ogni pezzo aggiunto allo scaffale potrebbe richiedere sacrifici economici importanti [...] la strada per il collezionista moderno è oggi più che mai in salita."

## Gold Nuggets

### GOLD NUGGET #1 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Il flipper europeo su Vinted (u/Dezuuu) — il manuale operativo definitivo**
> "I started selling some games I had (mainly on Vinted, as I'm based in Europe) in late 2021 and saw a huge amount of interesting games on there, as well as some titles that are rare and expensive in my country but cheap to find in others. It's incredibly easy to order and ship items on Vinted"

**PERCHÉ È ORO**: È il caso studio più specifico, completo e operativo del mercato europeo. Contiene la strategia esatta (niching, arbitraggio linguistico, PS3 backward-compatible, webstore locali). È verbatim di un operatore reale con €13.500 di risultato documentato. Ogni singola tattica è replicabile da un piccolo venditore su Vinted.

---

### GOLD NUGGET #2 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**L'arbitraggio linguistico italiano specifico**
> "games released in Italy and Germany are almost always released with an Italian or German packaging [...] One would be Yggdra Union (GBA) which goes for €200 when it's a new and sealed copy. However there are new and sealed copies available from Italy that are very easy to find at just €40"
> "Steambot Chronicles, usually considered a €80-120 game, easily available from various European countries for around €30"

**PERCHÉ È ORO**: Rivela un vantaggio competitivo SPECIFICO per un venditore italiano — non generico, ma con titoli precisi, prezzi precisi, margini precisi (5x). È il tipo di insight che cambia un business.

---

### GOLD NUGGET #3 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**La tensione invest vs. play — la contraddizione centrale del mercato**
> "Fine by me I didnt treat my games as an investment vehicle their value is irrelevant to me. Hell the only reason ive sold games is because I think theyre too expensive and I feel guilty having a $500 dollar game when that could be in an investment account making my life and my families lives easier someday."

**PERCHÉ È ORO**: Rivela la contraddizione psicologica più profonda del collezionista: dice che non gliene importa del valore, ma il senso di colpa per avere giochi da $500 è attivissimo. Il mercato si spacca esattamente su questo asse. Un venditore che capisce questo può posizionarsi.

---

### GOLD NUGGET #4 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Il punto di dolore della falsificazione in esplosione (2026)**
> "I want to bring attention to this because this is the 2nd time in the last 5 months I've come across a SNES copy of Mega Man X3 with this BS fake label and what bothers me is how close it is to the real thing."
> "How are you guys finding these deals? All I'm getting are scams."

**PERCHÉ È ORO**: In 2026 la paura del falso è diventata acuta. Chi può garantire autenticità ha un vantaggio competitivo enorme. È il pain point su cui costruire fiducia e differenziazione.

---

### GOLD NUGGET #5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Il mercato italiano descritto dall'interno (2026)**
> "La rarità non è più l'unico parametro: oggi, lo stato di conservazione è il vero ago della bilancia. Un gioco completo di scatola, manuale e inserti originali può raggiungere cifre vertiginose, mentre il settore del 'sealed' è diventato terreno esclusivo per investitori e collezionisti di alto profilo."
— ItaliaIoVideogioco, 6 Febbraio 2026

**PERCHÉ È ORO**: Fonte italiana recente, definisce il nuovo parametro di valore (condizione > rarità), identifica il target high-end (sealed/investitori) e quello mid-market (CIB), e fotografa il momento preciso in cui si trova il mercato.

---

### GOLD NUGGET #6 ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**La saturazione del mercato è percepita, ma le opportunità esistono ancora**
> "Video Games are and have been the most over saturated flipping category for at least the last 10 years" [score 24]
vs.
> "I'm honestly still a bit shocked that deals like this still exist in 2026. My luck is officially peaked for the year." [score 30, Vinted 2026]

**PERCHÉ È ORO**: Contraddizione operativa diretta. Il mercato si auto-racconta come saturo, ma le opportunità reali esistono ancora — per chi sa cercale. La differenza è la specializzazione di nicchia.

---

### GOLD NUGGET #7 ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**L'unica guida ai prezzi (PriceCharting) è già screditata dalla community**
> "My disdain for price charting knows no bounds. The fact that every man and his dog is starting to use it is annoying, even more so that Pricecharting doesn't include AUS sales."
> "Don't trust Pricecharting (too much)"

**PERCHÉ È ORO**: Chi sa usare fonti di pricing migliori (eBay sold listings per paese, Vinted completed, marketplace locali) ha un vantaggio informativo reale su chi si fida di PriceCharting — specialmente in Europa dove PriceCharting è più inaffidabile.

---

### GOLD NUGGET #8 ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**La tattica del PS3 backward compatible — ROI 300%**
> "Most of you probably know they can be recognized by the model number, 4-USB ports, memory card slot etc., but there's a much easier way to identify them: the front part is reflective. [...] Many sellers who own one of these have no clue that they are selling one of these models [...] You can often purchase this model for around €50 before anyone else can."

**PERCHÉ È ORO**: Tattica iper-specifica, con percentuale di ROI quantificata (+300% probabilità di trovare un BC PS3), meccanismo di identificazione visiva descritto passo per passo. Replicabile domani.

---

### GOLD NUGGET #9 ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Il negozio locale come benchmark di fiducia perduto**
> "They werent the cheapest but at least their prices were consistent and they had good stock. [...] i really miss being able to browse physical inventory and actually see the condition before buying, and now I realize how good I had it."

**PERCHÉ È ORO**: Definisce esattamente COSA vogliono i collezionisti da un venditore (anche online): coerenza dei prezzi + condizione verificabile + stock affidabile. Non il prezzo più basso, ma la certezza.

---

### GOLD NUGGET #10 ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Il grading è tossico per il 90% della community**
> "Grading was brought into the videogames hobby by money hungry speculators who don't have any interest beyond hype and value"
> "The same people who ruined comics, sports cards and CCGs by grading them are the same ones who ruined the video game hobby by grading games."
> "I'd sooner sell my whole collection than to grade anything."

**PERCHÉ È ORO**: Chi vende su Vinted/eBay NON deve parlare di grading, certificazioni WATA o sealed investment grade. La community lo percepisce come tradimento dell'hobby. Il posizionamento corretto è anti-speculazione.

**Il collezionismo come "treasure hunt" — la motivazione emotiva primaria**
> "Its more of the treasure hunt in the store that matters and also the memories with my girls."
> "Thrift Gods Smiled on Me Yesterday!"
> "Nearly screamed when I saw Earthbound."
> "My heart sank! 😭"

**PERCHÉ È ORO**: Il collezionista non compra un prodotto — compra un'emozione. La caccia, la scoperta, il "quasi-scream". Un venditore che capisce questo nella comunicazione delle sue listings converte molto di più.

### GOLD NUGGET #12 ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Le aste Heritage sono crollate del 73% da 2021 a 2023**
> "Crollo -73% volume aste Heritage da Q3 2021 ad aprile 2023"
— Rally Research Team, Q2 2023

**PERCHÉ È ORO**: Il mercato hype del sealed/investment è deflazionato. Il mercato del "giocare" e del "collezionare per gioia" è resiliente. Chi entra ora nel mercato mid-tier (CIB, usato autentico) è nel segmento giusto — non in quello che è crollato.

### GOLD NUGGET #13 ⭐⭐⭐
**Il collezionismo inizia sempre con la nostalgia, finisce con il budget**
> "I never had a SNES growing up. We only had a Genesis, so I missed out on all the great Nintendo games from the 16 bit era. Well, flash forward to 2026 and I'm finally digging into the classics."
> "I've been collecting since about 2020 when my siblings and I got the switch. The majority of everything here is thrifted"

**PERCHÉ È ORO**: Il funnel di acquisizione del collezionista è chiaro: nostalgia (infanzia mancata o riconquistata) → budget adulto → acquisto. Chi intercetta il momento giusto (adulto 30-45 anni con reddito disponibile) trova il cliente ideale.

### GOLD NUGGET #14 ⭐⭐⭐
**La community è la barriera di ingresso, non il capitale**
> "You'll probably even end up getting regular customers who recognize your passion and knowledge."
> "I own a game store as well [...] I feel like I have to wait as the town grows first."
> "Skipping Community Engagement: 30% of Collectors" — RetroTechLab error stats

**PERCHÉ È ORO**: Il capitale di relazione (community) batte il capitale finanziario nel retrogaming. I venditori piccoli su Vinted/eBay che costruiscono una reputazione di competenza convertono meglio dei grandi venditori anonimi.

### GOLD NUGGET #15 ⭐⭐⭐
**Il segmento di acquirenti "forzo la vendita" è un'opportunità di sourcing**
> "My brother is sick [...] my collection is the only thing I have of value that can make a difference."
> "As someone who sold my collection off during uni to afford food and has spent ten years rebuilding"
> "I sold a PS3 lot last October for $80 (after he talked me down) on Facebook"

**PERCHÉ È ORO**: La necessità economica di vendere veloce (e in blocco, a sconto) crea un flusso costante di sourcing per chi sa identificarsi come compratore serio e affidabile. È il canale di approvvigionamento meno competitivo.

## Pattern Emergenti

### PATTERN 1: Il paradosso dell'investimento
Il 70% della community dichiara apertamente di non collezionare per investimento — e allo stesso tempo monitora i prezzi, usa PriceCharting, si sente "in colpa" per giochi da $500. Il mercato è mosso dall'emozione ma si legittima (anche a se stesso) con la logica del valore. Chi comunica "non è investimento, è passione" vince fiducia, ma chi aiuta a monitorare il valore viene ascoltato.

### PATTERN 2: La saturazione percepita blocca i nuovi entranti, non i veterani
"Everyone and their grandma knows to look out for [video games]" — eppure deals reali continuano a emergere ogni settimana su Vinted. La saturazione è un narrativa che scoraggia i concorrenti generalisti, non i nichespecialisti. Il piccolo venditore specializzato in 2-3 piattaforme/generi specifici trova ancora margini significativi.

### PATTERN 3: La condizione ha sostituito la rarità come primo parametro di valore
"La rarità non è più l'unico parametro: oggi, lo stato di conservazione è il vero ago della bilancia." (ItaliaIoVideogioco, 2026). CIB, box integra, manuale incluso — questi sono i differenziali di prezzo reali oggi. Non è la rarità del titolo ma la qualità del pezzo.

### PATTERN 4: Il mercato europeo (e italiano) ha asimmetrie informative strutturali
Le versioni linguistiche nazionali (italiano, francese, tedesco) creano nicchie di arbitraggio persistenti, ignorate da PriceCharting. I giochi con packaging italiano valgono molto di più in Italia di quanto valgano in Francia — e viceversa. Chi conosce queste asimmetrie può fare arbitraggio geografico sistematico su Vinted.

### PATTERN 5: La paura del falso è il driver di fiducia più potente nel 2026
Il boom delle falsificazioni (Pokemon, Mega Man X3, Switch, GBA) ha trasformato "autenticità garantita" da commodity a vantaggio competitivo. I venditori che documentano con foto dettagliate, board photos, materiali interni, hanno un tasso di conversione significativamente superiore.

### PATTERN 6: La community riflette e amplifica i prezzi
"When I sell my used games locally, the pokemon games are the first to go every single time. None last more than an hour after posting." — La domanda non è andata. Il ciclo nostalgia (millennial 30-40 anni con reddito) continua. Il problema è il sourcing, non la domanda.

### PATTERN 7: Il small seller su Vinted/eBay ha vantaggi strutturali sui grandi negozi
Fee più basse (Vinted zero per il venditore base), nessun overhead fisico, possibilità di specializzazione assoluta, rapporto diretto con il compratore. I grandi negozi locali chiudono sotto il peso dei costi fissi. Il micro-venditore digitale è il modello più sostenibile del settore nel 2025-2026.

### PATTERN 8: Il trigger di acquisto è quasi sempre emotivo, non razionale
"Nearly screamed", "My heart sank 😭", "Childhood dream achieved", "I'm honestly still a bit shocked". Il processo di acquisto nel retrogaming è emotivo prima, razionale poi. Le listing che attivano emozione (descrizioni con storia del pezzo, foto evocative, linguaggio di scoperta) battono le listing tecniche.

### PATTERN 9: Chi conosce il prodotto meglio del compratore vende di più
"Knowing a niche means you find games that others who are looking for a profit have already overlooked." Il knowledge gap tra venditore informato e acquirente medio è ancora enorme. Un venditore che spiega perché un gioco vale, cosa cercare per l'autenticità, quale versione è più rara — diventa un riferimento fidato e ottiene repeat customers.

### PATTERN 10: Il mercato si polarizza tra investimento (sealed/graded) e collezionismo (CIB/usato per giocare)
Due mercati distinti, con psicologie distinte, prezzi distinti, canali distinti. Il primo è in deflazione post-2021. Il secondo è stabile e in crescita. Un piccolo venditore su Vinted/eBay deve scegliere il secondo segmento — e comunicarlo esplicitamente.
